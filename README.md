# Bitcoin-_Price_Prediction_with_DeepLearning_LSTM
Long Short-Term Memory networks, or LSTMs for short, can be applied to time series forecasting.

There are many types of LSTM models that can be used for each specific type of time series forecasting problem.

In this project, I will discover how to develop LSTM models for a Bitcoin price time series forecasting problems.
